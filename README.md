There are two ways to start website:
1. Localhost
- Download php
- Open CMD and write "php -S localhost:1111" on the directory that contains index.php (use can change the port 1111 to whatever you want)
- Open browser, type on URL bar: "localhost:1111/index.php"

2. Directly on domain: https://ec0mmerce-project.herokuapp.com/docs/index.php (very unstable because deployers don't support PHP and database directory is out of root directory)

Accounts to use:

- Customer:
